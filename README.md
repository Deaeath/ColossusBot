## **Security Features**

**Security** is one of the **biggest selling points** of ColossusBot. In the world of self-hosted bots, **Discord** provides very little protection once a server or account is compromised. With ColossusBot, however, you have complete control over your server's security, especially in the event that an admin or mod account becomes compromised.

### **How ColossusBot Protects Your Server**:

1. **Self-Hosting with Elevated Bot Permissions**:
   ColossusBot is designed to be self-hosted, giving you full control over its configuration. Once hosted, you can assign the bot the **highest role** in your server, giving it ultimate control over sensitive server actions. This ensures that the bot can manage potentially dangerous situations that would otherwise be beyond its control.

2. **Event Listeners to Prevent Malicious Actions**:
   ColossusBot uses **event listeners** to detect any suspicious activity, such as changes to roles, permissions, or server settings. These event listeners are built to **prevent compromised mods or admins from causing harm**—for instance, it will stop malicious users from:
   - Changing key server configurations.
   - Kicking or banning high-level users.
   - Deleting important channels or messages.
   - Mass moderation actions by hacked accounts.
   
   This built-in protection is an essential feature, as it provides a safeguard against those who have taken control of admin privileges but cannot take full control of the bot.

3. **Server Ownership and Role Hierarchy Best Practices**:
   - **Lock the server behind a burner account**: A **burner account** should be used as a first line of defense to **lock down** access to your server. This account is used to prevent anyone from gaining unauthorized access or making drastic changes to server settings.
   
   - **Rotate ownership regularly**: **Rotate bot ownership** periodically to ensure it remains under the control of a trusted individual. This can help mitigate risks from potential internal threats or external hacks.

   - **Bot Role Above Everyone Except the Owner**: The bot's role should be positioned **above** all other users, including moderators and admins. This ensures that only the bot itself (or the owner) can execute important actions such as:
     - Preventing server nuking.
     - Reversing permission changes made by compromised accounts.

   - **Use your main account with limited permissions**: After setting up the bot with a high-level role, the **main user** should place their main account **below the bot** in the role hierarchy and limit permissions. This way, even if the main account is compromised, the bot cannot be controlled or its actions undone by malicious users.

4. **A Full Security Barrier Against Hacks**:
   With these techniques, ColossusBot helps ensure that **hackers cannot easily take over or nuke your server**. ColossusBot will effectively act as an additional line of defense, providing real-time monitoring of the server’s activities and mitigating risks before they escalate.

By combining these self-hosting best practices with the bot's built-in event listeners and role configurations, **ColossusBot offers robust protection against the threats of server takeover** and helps ensure the integrity of your server.

## **Detailed Component Overview**

### **Client Handler**

The `ClientHandler` manages **Discord bot initialization**, including the setup of:
- **Intents**: Determines what events the bot listens to.
- **Command Prefix**: Configurable via `.env`.

### **Database Handler**

The `DatabaseHandler` is a **centralized solution for managing SQL queries** and database schema. It supports **SQLite** (default) and **MySQL**, ensuring scalability for both development and production environments.

#### **Key Features**
##### **1. Schema Management**
   - Automatically creates and manages tables on startup, ensuring necessary structures are in place.
   - Handles schema migrations when tables or columns are updated, ensuring smooth transitions.
##### **2. Centralized Queries**
   - Encapsulates all SQL logic, keeping other parts of the codebase clean and focused on business logic.
   - Use functions like `execute`, `fetchone`, and `fetchall` for consistent query execution across the bot.
##### **3. Thread-Safe**
   - Supports asynchronous connections, allowing for high-performance environments with minimal blocking operations.
##### **4. Flexible Database Support**
   - Seamlessly supports both SQLite and MySQL, offering scalability from small to large production environments.
   - Automatically adjusts to the database engine provided in the configuration (SQLite or MySQL).

#### **Example Usage**
Define a schema in `setup()` and access it from other components:

```python
# Create a guild configuration table
async def setup(self):
    query = """
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS guild_config (
            guild_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            log_channel_id INTEGER,
            owner_id INTEGER
        )
    """
    await self.execute(query)

# Insert or update a guild's configuration
async def set_guild_config(self, guild_id: int, log_channel_id: int, owner_id: int):
    query = """
        INSERT INTO guild_config (guild_id, log_channel_id, owner_id)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        ON CONFLICT(guild_id) DO UPDATE SET
        log_channel_id = ?, owner_id = ?
    """
    await self.execute(query, (guild_id, log_channel_id, owner_id, log_channel_id, owner_id))
```

### **Event Handler**


#### **Key Features**

The `EventHandler` cog serves as the centralized controller for handling a wide variety of Discord events. It listens to key events, such as incoming messages and reactions, and routes them to the appropriate listeners or modules for processing. This architecture enables the bot to react to different types of interactions in an organized and modular way.

1. The `EventHandler` listens for key events across all active guilds, ensuring that the bot responds to interactions promptly.
2. For each event type (e.g., messages or reactions), the event handler delegates processing to the appropriate listener modules:
   - **AIChatbot** for conversational AI responses.
   - **NSFWChecker** for NSFW detection and alerts.
   - **FlaggedWordsAlert** for monitoring flagged keywords.
   - **RepeatedMessageAlert** for detecting and responding to repeated messages.
   - **ActiveAlertChecker** for logging and checking channel activity.
3. The bot performs periodic checks for ticket channels, ensuring they are kept up to date and closed when inactive.
4. The event handler ensures real-time processing of messages and reactions, while managing long-running tasks like ticket monitoring.

This modular, event-driven approach allows ColossusBot to scale efficiently, handling multiple types of events without compromising performance.

The `EventHandler` also runs periodic tasks, such as checking the activity of ticket channels, ensuring the bot can handle long-running processes while still focusing on real-time event handling.

##### **1. Message Events**

- **Message Processing**:
  The `EventHandler` listens for all incoming messages across the bot's active guilds. When a message is received:
  - It is routed through multiple specialized listeners to handle various checks and responses:
    - **AIChatbot**: Processes the message for AI-based responses.
    - **NSFWChecker**: Detects inappropriate or NSFW content and takes action.
    - **FlaggedWordsAlert**: Monitors for flagged keywords or phrases in the message.
    - **RepeatedMessageAlert**: Checks if the message is a repeated message.
    - **ActiveAlertChecker**: Logs the activity of the channel where the message was posted and checks for active alerts.

  Each listener performs its specific task and handles the message accordingly, whether that means sending alerts, muting users, or performing other actions.

##### **2. Reaction Events**

- **Reaction Handling**:
  The `EventHandler` also listens for reaction events, triggered when a user adds a reaction to a message. This is commonly used for alerting or processing actions like approvals or rejections:
    - **NSFWChecker**: Checks if the reaction is related to an NSFW content alert, and handles it accordingly.
    - **FlaggedWordsAlert**: Processes reactions on flagged word alerts, enabling staff to take actions like issuing warnings or muting the user.
    - **RepeatedMessageAlert**: Handles reactions for actions related to repeated message detection, allowing staff to decide on the severity of the action to take.

  These reactions are processed in real-time, allowing staff to take appropriate actions based on the severity of the alert or content.

##### **3. Periodic Tasks**

- **Ticket Channel Activity**:
  The `EventHandler` includes a periodic task that checks ticket channels (channels named `ticket-*`) for recent activity. Every 5 minutes:
  - It checks if there has been activity in any ticket channel. If no messages have been posted within the last 60 minutes, the bot sends a reminder to the user to keep the ticket open.
  - If there is still no activity after 60 minutes, the bot sends commands to close the ticket, send a transcript, and then delete the channel.

This task ensures that the bot maintains an active and well-managed ticket system, closing inactive tickets to keep the server organized.

### **Web Dashboard**

The web dashboard provides a **real-time interface** for managing and monitoring ColossusBot.

#### **Key Features**
##### **1. Index Page (index.html)**
   - Displays a welcome message and links to other sections.
##### **2. Console Logs (console.html)**
   - Shows real-time logs with a toggle for autoscroll.
##### **3. API Endpoints**
   - /api/status: Returns bot status (online, latency, guild count).
   - /api/console: Fetches the latest console logs.
   - /api/commands: Returns metadata for all available commands.

   - Keep logic modular to avoid duplicating code.

2. **Centralize Database Operations**:
   - Avoid writing SQL queries directly in cogs or commands.
   - Use the DatabaseHandler for consistent and maintainable query management.

3. **Separate Logic and Presentation**:
   - Keep UI logic (dashboard HTML/CSS) separate from backend operations (handlers).
   - Use the Renderer class to manage HTML rendering.

4. **Logging**:
   - Use the built-in logging framework to log errors and events.
   - Avoid printing directly to the console unless necessary for debugging.

### **Command and Cog Templates**

#### **Command Template**

The commands/ directory is for **simple, self-contained commands**. Use the _command_template.py to create new commands.

Example:
```python
"""
Template Command: Example Command for ColossusBot
-------------------------------------------------
Use this template to create and add new commands to the bot.
"""

from discord.ext import commands
from discord import Embed
import logging

# Initialize logging for debugging purposes
logger = logging.getLogger("ColossusBot")

class CommandTemplate(commands.Cog):
    """
    A template cog for creating commands in ColossusBot.
    """

    def __init__(self, client: commands.Bot) -> None:
        """
        Initializes the CommandTemplate cog.

        :param client: The Discord bot client instance.
        """
        self.client = client
        logger.info("CommandTemplate initialized successfully.")

    @commands.command(name="example", help="An example command to demonstrate functionality.")
    async def example_command(self, ctx: commands.Context, *, input_text: str = "Default Response") -> None:
        """
        Responds with a user-provided message or a default response.

        :param ctx: The command context.
        :param input_text: The input text provided by the user (optional).
        """
        logger.info(f"Executing 'example_command' with input: {input_text}")

        # Create an embed to display the response
        embed = Embed(
            title="Example Command",
            description=f"You said: {input_text}",
            color=0x00FF00
        )
        await ctx.send(embed=embed)

    @commands.command(name="another_example", help="Another example command to show usage with arguments.")
    async def another_example_command(self, ctx: commands.Context, number: int) -> None:
        """
        Multiplies a number by 2 and returns the result.

        :param ctx: The command context.
        :param number: A number provided by the user.
        """
        logger.info(f"Executing 'another_example_command' with number: {number}")

        result = number * 2
        await ctx.send(f"Double of {number} is {result}!")


async def setup(client: commands.Bot) -> None:
    """
    Registers the CommandTemplate cog with the bot.

    :param client: The Discord bot client instance.
    """
    logger.info("Setting up CommandTemplate cog...")
    await client.add_cog(CommandTemplate(client))
    logger.info("CommandTemplate cog setup complete.")
```

#### **Cog Template**

For **complex features with database or event integrations**, use the _cog_template.py.

Example:
```python
"""
Template Cog for ColossusBot
----------------------------
Use this template for creating new cogs with handler integration.
"""

from discord.ext import commands
import logging
from handlers.database_handler import DatabaseHandler

logger = logging.getLogger("ColossusBot")


class CogTemplate(commands.Cog):

Got it! Here's the updated README with the inclusion of the various **reaction sets** across the different listeners (excluding `active_alert_checker.py`, which doesn't have reactions). I've also expanded the list of emojis to cover all available reactions mentioned:

### **5. `listeners/`**

The `listeners/` directory contains cogs that handle various types of event-driven actions in ColossusBot. These listeners provide core functionality such as monitoring activity, handling flagged content, detecting NSFW material, and tracking repeated messages. Each listener responds to specific events within Discord and takes action based on those events. Here is an overview of the listeners in this directory:

#### **1. `active_alert_checker.py`**

**Purpose**: The `active_alert_checker.py` listener is designed to track and log channel activity. It monitors the time difference between the last message sent in a channel and the current message. When a channel becomes active again (after inactivity), it logs the activity in a designated log channel.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Channel Activity Tracking**: This listener keeps track of when a channel becomes active by comparing the time difference between the last message and the current message.
  - **Log Channel**: Once a channel becomes active, it sends an activity log message to a designated log channel.
  - **No Reaction Handling**: Unlike other listeners, the `active_alert_checker.py` does not involve reactions. Instead, it purely logs channel activity.

- **Note**: This listener does **not** use reactions or require staff interaction. It simply logs the channel's activity in a dedicated log channel.

#### **2. `flagged_words_alert.py`**

**Purpose**: The `flagged_words_alert.py` listener detects and alerts staff when potentially harmful or inappropriate words are used in messages.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Flagged Words Detection**: Monitors messages for words or phrases from a predefined list of flagged terms.
  - **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends alerts to staff when flagged words are detected in a message.
  - **Reactions Handling**: Staff can use reactions like ✅ (approve action) or ❌ (ignore) to take actions on the flagged content.

- **Take Action**:
  When a flagged word is detected, staff are notified, and they can:
  - **✅**: Approve the alert (issue a penalty).
  - **❌**: Dismiss the alert.

- **Penalty Emojis**:
  - **⚠️**: Issue a warning to the user.
  - **🔇**: Mute the user.
  - **👢**: Kick the user from the server.
  - **🔨**: Ban the user.

#### **3. `nsfw_checker.py`**

**Purpose**: The `nsfw_checker.py` listener scans messages for NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, including explicit images, videos, and text.

- **Key Features**:
  - **NSFW Content Detection**: Uses integrated tools to scan messages for explicit content, both in text and media (e.g., images, videos).
  - **Automatic Actions**: Can automatically take actions such as deleting inappropriate messages or warning the user.
  - **Reactions Handling**: Allows staff to react to alerts to take further action.

- **Take Action**:
  When NSFW content is detected:
  - **✅**: Approve the alert (issue a penalty).
  - **❌**: Dismiss the alert.

- **Penalty Emojis**:
  - **⚠️**: Issue a warning to the user.
  - **🔇**: Mute the user.
  - **👢**: Kick the user from the server.
  - **🔨**: Ban the user.

#### **4. `repeated_message_alert.py`**

**Purpose**: The `repeated_message_alert.py` listener detects when the same or similar messages are repeatedly sent across different guilds or channels, helping to flag spammy behavior.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Repeated Message Detection**: Monitors for repeated messages that are identical or nearly identical across different servers or channels.
  - **Cross-Guild Monitoring**: Can detect repeated messages from users in different guilds.
  - **Staff Alerts**: Sends alerts to staff when repeated messages are detected, enabling quick action to be taken.
  - **Reactions Handling**: Staff can react to alerts to approve or dismiss actions on the repeated message.

- **Take Action**:
  When a repeated message is detected, staff can take actions such as:
  - **✅**: Approve the alert (issue a penalty).
  - **❌**: Dismiss the alert.

- **Penalty Emojis**:
  - **⚠️**: Issue a warning to the user.
  - **🔇**: Mute the user.
  - **👢**: Kick the user from the server.
  - **🔨**: Ban the user.

#### **How Reactions Work in Listeners**

The following listeners use reactions as a way to quickly take action on alerts:

- **Flagged Words Alert Listener (`flagged_words_alert.py`)**
- **NSFW Checker Listener (`nsfw_checker.py`)**
- **Repeated Message Alert Listener (`repeated_message_alert.py`)**

In these listeners, reactions are used by moderators or staff to confirm, approve, or dismiss alerts generated by the bot. The reactions include:

- **✅**: Confirm the alert (e.g., deleting a message, issuing a penalty).
- **❌**: Dismiss the alert.
- **⚠️**: Issue a warning to the user.
- **🔇**: Mute the user.
- **👢**: Kick the user from the server.
- **🔨**: Ban the user.

Each listener is designed to help staff manage and moderate their servers by making it easier to interact with alerts and take action swiftly. These listeners monitor different aspects of server activity, such as message content, NSFW material, repeated messages, and overall channel activity. By using reactions, staff can take immediate actions based on the alerts generated by the bot.
